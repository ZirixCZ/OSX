            <h2>1) Don't swear.</h2>
            <li>- This means, don't say rude words any place in the server. Bypasses will result in greater punishment.</li>
            <h2>2) No links.</h2>
            <li>- Don't send links including GIFs in the server because some can have NSFW content. For those who don’t know GIFs are like videos but they cannot be stopped or starting, and once the GIF has gone through one loop it will restart.</li>
            <h2>3) No NSFW.</h2>
            <li>- Don't send or post NSFW any place in this server and or DM's, this will end in a ban for @everyone and we will report your discord account to the Discord trust and safety team.</li>
            <h2>4) No racial or sexist slurs.</h2>
            <li>- We do not allow any type of racial and or sexist slurs, if you bypass any of them or give it an appearance of it being a slur using the spoiler feature it will result in a ban</li>
            <h2>5) No roleplay.</h2>
            <li>- Please don't roleplay in this server because it can be quiet annoying. Roleplay is when you act out something in a text channel. Examples are ‘Red vented in front of me!’ and ‘can I have a Big Mac.’</li>
            <h2>6) Keep inside channels topics.</h2>
            <li>- If you just want a general conversation, go to the general channel, for bot commands please keep them inside the bot commands channel.</li>
            <h2>7) Respect other people.</h2>
            <li>- Disrespect is not allowed in this server.</li>
            <h2>8) No advertising.</h2>
            <li>- We highly discourage people from DM advertising as it can lead to actions that are against the Discord ToS such as DM spam which can cause your account to be disabled. This will get you banned for @everyone.
                - Advertising outside the channels made for it is not allowed.</li>
            <h2>9) Common Sense.</h2>
            <li>- This is not the full list of rules, Please use common sense at all times about what you are about to do/say.</li>
            <h2>10) Don't spam.</h2>
            <li>- Spam is not allowed in this server and it can get you muted.</li>
            <h2>11) No flashing emoji's.</h2>
            <li>- Flashing emotes and or emoji's are NOT allowed due to people who suffer from epilepsy.</li>
            <h2>12) Pings.</h2>
            <li>- Please do not ping OSX when they have "[sleeping]" in there status</li>
            <h2>13) This is an English only server.</h2>
            <li>- This means you can only speak English.</li>
            <h2>14) The Discord ToS and guidelines apply at all times.</h2>
            <li><a href="https://discordapp.com/terms">- https://discordapp.com/terms</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://discordapp.com/guidelines">- https://discordapp.com/guidelines</a></li>
            <h2>15) Don't ask and or beg for anything.</h2>
            <li>- Asking for anything will get you warned, even if you're joking.
                - If you ask a question like "Can I have a role" or "Can you punish me" its still counted as asking.</li>
            <h2>16) Make actual suggestions.</h2>
            <li>- When making a suggestion when using the ">suggestion" command make sure you make an actual suggestion and not stuff like "make me mod/admin"</li>
